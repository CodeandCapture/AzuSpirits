          <h4>Health Consequences of Consuming Alcohol</h4>
          <p>

 We encourage responsible drinking of alcohol, and include health warnings both in our website and on our product. CMO’s low-risk drinking guidelines state;

·  To keep health risks from alcohol to a low level it is safest not to drink more than 14 units a week on a regular basis

·  If you regularly drink as much as 14 units per week, it's best to spread your drinking evenly over three or more days. If you have one or two heavy drinking episodes a week, you increase your risk of long-term illness and injury

·  The risk of developing a range of health problems (including cancers of the mouth, throat and breast) increases the more you drink on a regular basis</p>
